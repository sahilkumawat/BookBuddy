# Rubik's Cube Solver App

## Overview
The Rubik's Cube Solver App is an innovative iOS application designed to help users solve Rubik's Cubes effortlessly. By leveraging Apple's Core ML technology, the app enables users to take photos of each side of their Rubik's Cube. It then recognizes the colors, analyzes the current state of the cube, and provides a step-by-step guide to solve the puzzle.

## Main Features

[x] **Camera Functionality**: Allows users to take pictures of their Rubik's Cube for color analysis.
[] **Timer**: Provides a stopwatch that clocks the user's rubik's cube speed.
[] **History and Statistics**: Tracks users' solve times and improvement.

## Sprints

- **Sprint 1**: Project setup and integration of Core ML for color recognition.
