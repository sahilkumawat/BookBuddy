# Rubik's Cube Solver App

## Overview
The Rubik's Cube Solver App is an innovative iOS application designed to help users solve Rubik's Cubes effortlessly. By leveraging Apple's Core ML technology, the app enables users to take photos of each side of their Rubik's Cube. It then recognizes the colors, analyzes the current state of the cube, and provides a step-by-step guide to solve the puzzle.

## Features

- **Color Recognition**: Utilizes Apple's Core ML to accurately detect and classify the colors on each face of the Rubik's Cube from the user's photos.
- **Solution Generator**: Processes the color data and uses a powerful solving algorithm to generate a series of moves that lead to a solved cube.
- **Interactive Guide**: Offers a visual and interactive step-by-step guide that users can follow to solve their cube.
- **History Tracking**: Saves past solves, allowing users to review their previous solutions and times, fostering improvement and learning.
